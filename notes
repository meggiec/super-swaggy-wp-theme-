Notes about how I will go about this and stuff. 

Design ideas: 
- standard blog format is probably best. 
- but also an optional menu page would be cool because I plan to have so many diff things going on?
  - Personal stuff 
  - Books
  - Movies 
  - Ventures?
- Maybe there's not enough yet to warrant a menu page, so just tabs at top. 
- Oh, but I want like movie reviews and book reviews to have a food blog type interface at some point 
- But I also plan on writing about movies and books in a non-complete-review-way. So like specific things
- Or generic book-movii-story musings. 
- So that stuff would want the standard blog layout 

- I watched zootopia for the 2nd time today. it was gr8.
