# super-swaggy-wp-theme-

I have a blog (word press), but haven't actually published anything. 
I don't even like the way it looks. 

None of the free Word Press themes are pretty enough for my super particular standards. 

And then I was like wait. hold up. I can code. + I'm a cs major. 

Let me just make my own word press theme. 
(perhaps if I had realized this earlier I wouldn't have gone the word press route, but whatever). 

So here I am. 
because 30-day git challenge and mob mentality (?) motivated me. 

If I have half a word press theme by the end of this, I'll be happy. 
& bake my self a super-swaggy chocolate cake 
and eat it while watching YouTube videos from the many movie related 
YouTubers I subscribe to.
